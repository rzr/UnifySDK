## Known Issues

| Known Issue                                                                                                                                           | Workaround
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If connection to the MQTT broker is lost, ZigPC does not re-subscribe to topics                                                                       | Restart ZigPC.                                                                              |
| User may experience outdated devices that are still listed from cached data in the browser                                                            | A fresh browser session can remove outdated devices.                                        |
| Network management state is not published correctly if UPVL is started after ZigPC                                                                    | Start UPVL before ZigPC.                                                                    |
| The UPVL becomes unresponsive to MQTT messages and will miss MQTT messages published to "ucl/SmartStart/List/Update"                                  | Restart UPVL.                                                                               |
| Including a node using the SmartStart list is only effective for 18 hours                                                                             | Ensure that a node is added within 18 hours of being put in the SmartStart List.            |
| When performing network-steering, the device can either fail node addition or node interview partially.                                               | In the device's EmberCLI, enter the commands `network leave` and `keys clear` then retry.   |
| When excluding devices, the protocol UNID is not removed from the node's SmartStart entry. This will cause the ZigPC to refuse to re-include the node.| Clear the ZigPC UNID from the SmartStart entry using the Dev UI.                            |
| ZigPC only supports "Remove" and "Idle" PC state change requests via the Node List view in DevUI. "Add" and "Reset" options are not supported.        | To add nodes to the Zigbee network, using the Smartstart DSK process outlined in the readme.|
| ZigPC can fail at initialization if the NCP image is based on GSDK 4.1 without ADDRESS_TABLE being set to 32                                          | Set macro `EMBER_ADDRESS_TABLE_SIZE=32` in NCP studio project before building NCP image.    |
| ZigPC can fail at initialization if the NCP image is based on a different version of the GeckoSDK than ZigPC                                          | Update the NCP image to the same GeckoSDK version as the one used to compile the ZigPC.     |
| ZigPC sends the default response to a sleepy check-in command instead of the expected acknowledge message                                             | Disable the poll control cluster when managing sleepy devices to use the default behaviour. |
| ZigPC may take longer than expected to perform an OTA upgrade                                                                                         | Minimize the size of the image and leave sufficient time to update end devices.             |
| When running in a multiprotocol setup, permission issues may cause the setup to fail                                                                  | Use 'sudo' when running both ZigPC and the Zigbeed applications to ensure compatibility     |
