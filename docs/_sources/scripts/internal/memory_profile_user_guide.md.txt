# Unify Memory Profiling User Guide

This guide is to explain the usage of the memory profiling scripts. At present, we support flash memory profiling and RAM memory profiling.

## Flash Memory Profiling

Flash memory profiling script is located at "scripts/internal".

### Flash Memory Script Execution

Note: Please unzip the unify package before running the script.

```bash
./flash_memory_profile.sh <Directory path>
```

Above Directory path should contain the location where the debain packages are placed.
the expected output will Package name and memory size.

## RAM Memory Profiling

RAM memory profiling script is located at "scripts/internal".

### RAM Memory Script Execution

Note: Please install the unify package before running the script.

```bash
// for any single UIC process
     ./RAM_memory_profile.sh <Process Name>

// for all UIC processes
     ./RAM_memory_profile.sh uic

// for all UIC processes and mosquitto
     ./RAM_memory_profile.sh all

the expected output will be RAM usage in KB based on RSS memory values for the Processes.
